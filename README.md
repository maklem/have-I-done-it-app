# Done?

Have I *DONE* it already?

I have a few important daily tasks. Some are done so quickly, that I tend to forget
whether I already did them. So I created an app that reminds me, and helps me
remember, when a task was completed last time.

# Join Testing!

As part of the requirements to publish an app, I need human testers.
